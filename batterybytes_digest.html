            <strong>Phase engineering of MoS$_2$ monolayers: A pathway to enhanced lithium-polysulfide battery performance</strong><br>
            <em>J. W. GonzÃ¡lez, E. FlÃ³rez, R. A. Gallardo, J. D. Correa</em><br>
            <small>2025-05-22</small><br>
            <p>This study explores the potential of MoS$_2$ polymorphs, specifically the
semiconducting 2H phase and the metallic 1T$^\prime$ phase, as anchoring
materials to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S)
batteries. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that
1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$ exhibits stronger Li-S interactions, greater charge
transfer, and enhanced catalytic activity compared to its 2H counterpart,
effectively suppressing polysulfide dissolution and facilitating redox
reactions. The reversible 2H$\leftrightarrow$1T$^\prime$ transition offers a
tunable design space for balancing conductivity and structural stability. These
findings position hybrid MoS$_2$ architectures as promising platforms for
next-generation Li-S batteries with improved energy density, cycling stability,
and rate capability.</p>

            <strong>End-to-End Framework for Predicting the Remaining Useful Life of Lithium-Ion Batteries</strong><br>
            <em>Khoa Tran, Tri Le, Bao Huynh, Hung-Cuong Trinh, Vy-Rin Nguyen</em><br>
            <small>2025-05-22</small><br>
            <p>Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is essential for
enabling timely maintenance of lithium-ion batteries, impacting the operational
efficiency of electric applications that rely on them. This paper proposes a
RUL prediction approach that leverages data from recent charge-discharge cycles
to estimate the number of remaining usable cycles. The approach introduces both
a novel signal processing pipeline and a deep learning prediction model. In the
signal preprocessing pipeline, a derived capacity feature is computed based on
current and capacity signals. Alongside original capacity, voltage and current,
these features are denoised and enhanced using statistical metrics and a
delta-based method to capture differences between the current and previous
cycles. In the prediction model, the processed features are then fed into a
hybrid deep learning architecture composed of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN), Attentional Long Short-Term Memory (A-LSTM), and Ordinary Differential
Equation-based LSTM (ODE-LSTM) modules. This architecture is designed to
capture both local signal characteristics and long-range temporal dependencies
while modeling the continuous-time dynamics of battery degradation. The model
is further evaluated using transfer learning across different learning
strategies and target data partitioning scenarios. Results indicate that the
model maintains robust performance, even when fine-tuned on limited target
data. Experimental results on two publicly available large-scale datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a baseline deep learning
approach and machine learning techniques, achieving an RMSE of 101.59,
highlighting its strong potential for real-world RUL prediction applications.</p>

            <strong>Scientific breakthrough brings CO2 'breathing' batteries closer to reality</strong> (Batteries News -- ScienceDaily)<br>
            <small>Tue, 20 May 2025 12:20:27 EDT</small><br>
            <p>Scientists have made a breakthrough in eco-friendly batteries that not only store more energy but could also help tackle greenhouse gas emissions. Lithium-CO2 'breathing' batteries release power while capturing carbon dioxide, offering a greener alternative that may one day outperform today's lithium-ion batteries.</p>

            <strong>World record for lithium-ion conductors</strong> (Batteries News -- ScienceDaily)<br>
            <small>Fri, 09 May 2025 12:22:47 EDT</small><br>
            <p>A team partially replaced lithium in a lithium antimonide compound with the metal scandium. This creates specific gaps, so-called vacancies, in the crystal lattice of the conductor material. These gaps help the lithium ions to move more easily and faster, resulting in a new world record for ion conductivity.</p>

            <p>Lithium-ion batteries have been a staple in device manufacturing for years, but the liquid electrolytes they rely on to function are quite unstable, leading to fire hazards and safety concerns.

            <strong>Rapid lithium extraction eliminates use of acid and high heat, scientists report</strong> (Batteries News -- ScienceDaily)<br>
            <small>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 14:19:16 EDT</small><br>
            <p>Lightweight lithium metal is a heavy-hitting critical mineral, serving as the key ingredient in the rechargeable batteries that power phones, laptops, electric vehicles and more. As ubiquitous as lithium is in modern technology, extracting the metal is complex and expensive. A new method enables high-efficiency lithium extraction -- in minutes, not hours -- using low temperatures and simple water-based leaching.</p>
