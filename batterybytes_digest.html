            <strong>Lifelong reinforcement learning for health-aware fast charging of lithium-ion batteries</strong><br>
            <em>Meng Yuan, Changfu Zou</em><br>
            <small>2025-05-16</small><br>
            <p>Fast charging of lithium-ion batteries remains a critical bottleneck for
widespread adoption of electric vehicles and stationary energy storage systems,
as improperly designed fast charging can accelerate battery degradation and
shorten lifespan. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a
health-aware fast charging strategy that explicitly balances charging speed and
battery longevity across the entire service life. The key innovation lies in
establishing a mapping between anode overpotential and the state of health
(SoH) of battery, which is then used to constrain the terminal charging voltage
in a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) framework. By
incorporating this SoH-dependent voltage constraint, our designed deep learning
method mitigates side reactions and effectively extends battery life. To
validate the proposed approach, a high-fidelity single particle model with
electrolyte is implemented in the widely adopted PyBaMM simulation platform,
capturing degradation phenomena at realistic scales. Comparative life-cycle
simulations against conventional CC-CV, its variants, and constant
current-constant overpotential methods show that the TD3-based controller
reduces overall degradation while maintaining competitively fast charge times.
These results demonstrate the practical viability of deep reinforcement
learning for advanced battery management systems and pave the way for future
explorations of health-aware, performance-optimized charging strategies.</p>

            <strong>User-centric Vehicle-to-Grid Optimization with an Input Convex Neural Network-based Battery Degradation Model</strong><br>
            <em>Arghya Mallick, Georgios Pantazis, Mohammad Khosravi, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani, Sergio Grammatico</em><br>
            <small>2025-05-16</small><br>
            <p>We propose a data-driven, user-centric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) methodology
based on multi-objective optimization to balance battery degradation and V2G
revenue according to EV user preference. Given the lack of accurate and
generalizable battery degradation models, we leverage input convex neural
networks (ICNNs) to develop a data-driven degradation model trained on
extensive experimental datasets. This approach enables our model to capture
nonconvex dependencies on battery temperature and time while maintaining
convexity with respect to the charging rate. Such a partial convexity property
ensures that the second stage of our methodology remains computationally
efficient. In the second stage, we integrate our data-driven degradation model
into a multi-objective optimization framework to generate an optimal smart
charging profile for each EV. This profile effectively balances the trade-off
between financial benefits from V2G participation and battery degradation,
controlled by a hyperparameter reflecting the user prioritization of battery
health. Numerical simulations show the high accuracy of the ICNN model in
predicting battery degradation for unseen data. Finally, we present a trade-off
curve illustrating financial benefits from V2G versus losses from battery
health degradation based on user preferences and showcase smart charging
strategies under realistic scenarios.</p>

            <strong>Quantum state-agnostic work extraction (almost) without dissipation</strong><br>
            <em>Josep Lumbreras, Ruo Cheng Huang, Yanglin Hu, Mile Gu, Marco Tomamichel</em><br>
            <small>2025-05-14</small><br>
            <p>We investigate work extraction protocols designed to transfer the maximum
possible energy to a battery using sequential access to $N$ copies of an
unknown pure qubit state. The core challenge is designing interactions to
optimally balance two competing goals: charging of the battery optimally using
the qubit in hand, and acquiring more information by qubit to improve energy
harvesting in subsequent rounds. Here, we leverage exploration-exploitation
trade-off in reinforcement learning to develop adaptive strategies achieving
energy dissipation that scales only poly-logarithmically in $N$. This
represents an exponential improvement over current protocols based on full
state tomography.</p>

            <strong>Electrochemical performance and diffusion kinetics of a NASICON type Na$_{3.3}$Mn$_{1.2}$Ti$_{0.75}$Mo$_{0.05}$(PO$_4$)$_3$/C cathode for low-cost sodium-ion batteries</strong><br>
            <em>Madhav Sharma, Rajendra S. Dhaka</em><br>
            <small>2025-05-13</small><br>
            <p>We report the electrochemical performance and diffusion kinetics of a newly
designed NASICON type Na$_{3.3}$Mn$_{1.2}$Ti$_{0.75}$Mo$_{0.05}$(PO$_4$)$_3$/C
composite material as a cathode for cost-effective sodium-ion batteries. A
novel strategy of small Mo doping successfully stabilizes the sample having
high Mn content in single phase rhombohedral symmerty. The high-resolution
microscopy analysis reveals nanocrystallites of around $\sim$18 nm, uniformly
embedded within the semi-graphitic carbon matrix, which enhances the surface
electronic conductivity and effectively shortens the sodium-ion diffusion path.
More importantly, we demonstrate a stable electrochemical behavior, with
enhanced discharge capacity of 124 mAh/g at 0.1 C, having good reversibility
and retaining 77\% of its capacity after 300 cycles, and 70\% even after 400
cycles at 2 C. The sodium-ion diffusion coefficients, estimated using both
galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry
are found to lie within the range of $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-11}$~cm$^2$/s.
Additionally, the bond-valence site energy mapping predicted a sodium-ion
migration energy barrier of 0.76 eV. A detailed distribution of relaxation
times (DRT) analysis is used to deconvolute the electrochemical impedance
spectra into distinct processes based on their characteristic relaxation times.
Notably, the solid-state diffusion of sodium ions within the bulk electrode,
with a relaxation time of $\sim$50 s, shows a consistent trend with the
diffusion coefficients obtained from GITT and Warburg-based evaluations across
the state of charge.</p>

            <p>A team partially replaced lithium in a lithium antimonide compound with the metal scandium. This creates specific gaps, so-called vacancies, in the crystal lattice of the conductor material.
